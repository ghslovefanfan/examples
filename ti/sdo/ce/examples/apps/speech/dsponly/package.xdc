 *  ======== package.xdc ========
 *  Codec Engine speech encoder example which utilizes a speech encoder
 *  codec which implements the 0.9 xDM speech interface.
 *
 *  This example builds using the XDC build tools, and is portable to
 *  multiple single procesor execution environments.  The following files are
 *  included in this package:
 *  @p(dlist)
 *      - `package.xdc`
 *          This file is required to declare a globally unique name for this
 *          package.
 *      - `package.bld`
 *          This file is the build script describing the application to the
 *          XDC built tools.
 *      - `makefile`
 *          A usability makefile wrapper around the XDC build tools.
 *      - `app.cfg`
 *          The XDC configuration file for this executable, when configured
 *          to run "local" codecs.  This is the typical configuration for
 *          single processor excution environments.
 *      - `app.tcf`
 *          The BIOS configuration file for this executable.  This file is
 *          only necessary when building for a BIOS runtime environment.
 *      - `app.c`
 *          The primary source file for this executable.
 *      - `main.c`
 *          The execution runtime-specific entry point for this executable.
 *          This isolates any runtime-specific startup code from the generic
 *          application.
